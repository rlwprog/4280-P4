Project 3 uses the Global option and passes all tests with files provided in project description online. Test cases to fail also failed.

To compile, type "make" from within the P3 directory. Upon making on the delmar server, many warning show up but do not affect the running of the program.

To run, from within the P3 directory, type "./statSem<P3_test1.fs182" where P3_test1.fs182 is the test file with input. 

Input can also be used from stdin if there is no input piped in from another file, i.e. running with the command "./statSem" and then inputing manually from standard in



Another way to run is to type "./statSem P2_test1" where "P2_test1" is the test file. 

".fs182" will automatically be appended to run invocations with two arguments. 


To clean, type "make clean"
